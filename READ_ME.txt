Vet Assistant


this is the page about vet doctor can review their vet assistants after assistants attend to the appointment session.

this is the html file
```

```

this is the css file 
```

```

this is js file
```

```

this is not a good UI experience for the vet doctors(users). So I need to make this more user friendly and attractive with the modern style with some animations too.

apart from this there is a sidebar which can be open and close. when it is open 250px and 88px used when close. home class includes

```
.home {
   position: relative;
   left: 250px;
   height: 100vh;
   width: calc(100% - 250px);
   background: var(--body-color);
   transition: var(--tran-05);
}

.home .text {
   font-size: 24px;
   font-weight: 500;
   color: var(--text-color);
   padding: 8px 40px;
}

.sidebar.close ~ .home {
   left: 88px;
   width: calc(100% - 88px);
}
```

this is my web page root color code
```
:root{
   --body-color: #E4E9F7;
   --sidebar-color: #FFF;
   --primary-color: #6a0dad;
   --primary-color-light: #f6f5ff;
   --toggle-color: #ddd;
   --text-color: #707070;
   --background-light: #c8a2c8;
   --background-primary: #6a0dad ;
   --background-white: #fff;
   --text-black: black;
   --text-primary: #6a0dad;
   --text-white: #fff;
   --shadow-color: slategray;
   --list-item: #ffecff;
 
   
   --tran-02: all 0.2s ease;
   --tran-03: all 0.3s ease;
   --tran-04: all 0.4s ease;
   --tran-05: all 0.5s ease;
}
```


Give me a single code without break down. I need single file. Give me best one. Don't forget I am still only UI interfaces that means I did not have still backend. So, I need hard coded output to see how UI is look likes
